README gstmythtvsrc
==========
gstmythtvsrc - cmyth based MythTV GStreamer source

It was written to use GStreamer enabled XBMC as MythTV Frontend, used on the ARM-platform Pandaboard.

Status: Works for me - this is the initial version after a (long) nightly write.
 

Requirements:
<---------->
GStreamer 0.10
cmyth - http://cmyth.github.com

Please contact me for bugs or any suggestions


Compiling and installing:
<---------->
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr
make
make install

When using another installation prefix make sure gstreamer finds it, e.g with
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10


How to use:
<---------->
Set the uri to the file or channel you want to play, e.g.
gst-launch playbin2 uri=myth://username:password@192.168.0.1/channels/7.ts
gst-launch playbin2 uri=myth://username:password@192.168.0.1/recordings/17413_20120823161000.mpg
